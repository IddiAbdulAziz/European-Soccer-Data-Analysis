# European-Soccer-Data-Analysis
In this assignment, we will be using an open dataset from the popular site Kaggle. This European Soccer Database has more than 25,000 matches and more than 10,000 players for European professional soccer seasons from 2008 to 2016.  Although we wonâ€™t be getting into the details of it for our example, the dataset even has attributes on weekly game updates, team line up, and detailed match events.  The goal of this notebook is to walk you through an end to end process of analyzing a dataset and introduce you to what we will be covering in this course. Our simple analytical process will include some steps for exploring and cleaning our dataset, some steps for predicting player performance using basic statistics, and some steps for grouping similar clusters using machine learning.  Let's get started with our Python journey!
